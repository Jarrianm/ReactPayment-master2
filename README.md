# Payment Calculator

## Instructions
Create a monthly payment calculator that matches the precalculate and postcalculate images you see in this repo. 

## Guidelines
- You must utilize the Loan class in Loan.js.
- You must create at least one separate component that gets imported into App.js. Totally up to you what that is. 
- The "Show Payment Info" button should trigger the initial render of the results, but after that the payment number should auto update on change on any input.
- Feel free have fun with the styling / layout. It does NOT have to match the images in that regard.
